# Security & Data Handling Guidelines

## üîí Security Requirements Overview
Based on [khadum_plan.txt](mdc:khadum_plan.txt) security specifications:

### Data Encryption Standards
- **Sensitive Data**: AES-256 encryption for bank accounts, personal info
- **Communications**: End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) for WhatsApp messages
- **Storage**: Encrypted storage for all PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OTP Verification**: WhatsApp-based OTP for login/verification
- **Access Levels**: System admin, freelancer, client role-based access
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with proper timeouts

## üö´ Content Filtering & Compliance
### Anti-Violation Measures
- **Text Analysis**: Prevent sharing of external contact info (phone numbers, external links)
- **Communication Monitoring**: All messages through bot only (no direct contact)
- **Automated Alerts**: System admin notifications for policy violations

### Data Privacy Rules
```tsx
// Example: Encrypted data handling
const encryptSensitiveData = (data: string) => {
  // AES-256 encryption implementation
  // Never log or expose sensitive data
};

const handleBankAccount = (iban: string) => {
  // Always encrypt before storage
  const encrypted = encryptSensitiveData(iban);
  // Store encrypted version only
};
```

## üîê Implementation Guidelines
### Frontend Security Practices
- **No Sensitive Data**: Never store encryption keys or sensitive data in frontend
- **API Security**: Use HTTPS only, implement proper CORS
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs, sanitize data
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose system details in error messages

### WhatsApp Integration Security
- **API Key Management**: Secure WhatsApp Business API key handling
- **Message Encryption**: Implement E2EE for all communications
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse
- **Audit Logs**: Track all interactions for security monitoring

## üí≥ Payment Security (Future Implementation)
### Payment Gateway Integration
- **PCI Compliance**: Follow PCI DSS standards for payment data
- **Gateway Options**: PayTabs, Mada integration with Saudi regulations
- **No Storage**: Never store complete payment card data
- **Secure Links**: Generate secure, time-limited payment links

### Financial Data Handling
```tsx
// Example: Secure payment processing
interface PaymentRequest {
  amount: number;
  currency: 'SAR';
  clientId: string;
  freelancerId: string;
  // Never include sensitive payment details
}
```
